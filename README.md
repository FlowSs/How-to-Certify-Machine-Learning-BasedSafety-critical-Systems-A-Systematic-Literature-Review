The file is a .xls file, with each sheet representing one step of our process:

* **Raw Data:** Sheet containing all the data post ***Pooling and Duplicate Fitlering*** (Section 3.4.2 in the paper). We give Title, Author, URL, Year extracted from the different databse (DB).

* **GS Round 2:** Sheet containing our decision for the step ***Second Round of Google Scholar Pruning*** (Section 3.4.3 in the paper). The decision process is in two steps, done by two reviewers that inspect title and abstract of papers for relevance to our study, that is if it's not out of our scope: First round (column ***Pass/Fail***) prunes papers by rejecting papers with two rejects (in red in the sheet) or accepting papers with two accepts (in green in the sheet). Papers were reviewers disagree (in orange in the sheet) lead to a discussion between reviewers, leading to the second round (***Decision Post Discussion***) where the final decision is taken.

* **Inclusion & Exclusion:** Sheet containing our decision for the step ***Inclusion and Exclusion criteri*** (Section 3.4.4 in the paper). The decision is in two steps, just like previously. Here, criteria evaluated are the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria presented in our paper.

* **Main sheet:** This main sheet regroups the papers considered for ***Quality Control Assessment*** (from Section 3.5 in our paper). We provide information used in the ***Data Extraction*** part (Section 3.6), as well as data used in our figure (venue, type of the venue, model type used...). Papers highlighted in red were rejected before Quality Control because they were out of our scope. Papers highlighted in blue were rejected for having a score too low during Quality Control evaluation. Note that we also count there the 4 papers of the snowballing process.

* **Control Question Score:** This sheet regroups the quality control scoring realized by two different reviewers. We summed the score obtained for questions Q1 to Q7, as well as the score for question Q8 et Q9a)/Q9b) as described in the paper. Then, average is taken. To be selected, a paper needs to have a score of at least 7 for questions Q1-Q7, and 1 for either Q8 or Q9a)/Q9b). Papers in green were accepted and papers in red rejected.
